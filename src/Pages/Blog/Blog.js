                    <p>1.Authentication verifies who the user is <br />
                        2.Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric
                        information, and other information provided or entered by the user.
                        3.Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.

                    <p>
                        1.Authorization determines what resources a user can access. <br />
                        2.Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user. <br />
                        3. Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.</p>

                    <p>
                        The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich,
                        collaborative applications by allowing secure access to
                        the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted
                        locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to
                        fire, giving the end user a responsive experience.
