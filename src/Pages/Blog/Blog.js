                    <h4>Difference between authorization and authentication?</h4>
                    <h6>Authentication</h6>
                    <p>1.Authentication verifies who the user is <br />
                        2.Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric
                        information, and other information provided or entered by the user.
                        3.Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.

                    <p>
                        1.Authorization determines what resources a user can access. <br />
                        2.Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user. <br />
                        3. Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.</p>

                    <h4>Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich,
                        collaborative applications by allowing secure access to
                        the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted
                        locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to
                        fire, giving the end user a responsive experience.
                        Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs,
                        and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app.
                        It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular
                        federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.</p>
